## Details of the project

### Local storage:
The podcast details and episodes are currently stored on local storage, but it's important to note that if too many podcasts are clicked, errors may arise due to local storage becoming full. To avoid this issue, a potential solution would be to set up a node server to store the podcast and episode data in a more efficient manner.
